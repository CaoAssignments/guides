UCSD has migrated to iClicker Cloud from iClicker classic in Winter 2024, so registering your iClicker may be slightly different than past quarters. **Note: We will start grading participation week 2.**

1) Go to https://www.iclicker.com/. If you already have an account, go to step 4. If not, continue to step 2.

2) Create a student account and search for University of California San Diego.

3) Register for an account using your **UCSD email**. Be sure to also add your PID to the Student ID section so that we can confirm that it is you.

4) Log in as a student. If this is a new account, it will ask you to register your remote. Register your remote with the remote ID on the back of the remote.

5) Click the "+" sign in the top right to add a class.

6) Select University of California San Diego and search for class number-quarter you are in. For example, if you are in CSE 12 for Winter 2025, you should search for 12-WI25. Select the class taught by Paul Cao. Click "Add This Course" and you should see the correct class in your Courses page. At this point, your iClicker remote should be registered and linked to you for when we port participation grades.
